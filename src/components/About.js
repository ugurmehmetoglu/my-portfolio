                <hr />
                <p>I'm a self-taught software engineer based in Los Angeles, CA. </p>

                <p>My passion is developing web applications. I love programming and systematically figuring out ways to build more efficient and usable systems. Iâ€™m an autonomous learner who works well onsite, in a team environment, and communicates effectively. I enjoy challenging myself with new problems and overcoming obstacles along the way.</p>
                <p>My self-taught journey with React, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL/MongoDB has been providing me the knowledge I need to make ideas a reality.</p>
